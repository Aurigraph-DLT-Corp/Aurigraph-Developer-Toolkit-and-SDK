## 🚀 Launch Command

When ready to deploy, invoke:

```bash
@J4CDeploymentAgent deploy-all --to=production --strategy=incremental
```

This will:
1. Deploy SDK packages (npm, PyPI, Go)
2. Deploy Mobile apps (iOS + Android)
3. Deploy Website (Next.js)
4. Deploy Infrastructure services
5. Run smoke tests (@QAQCAgent)
6. Verify all endpoints
7. Alert on any failures

---

## ✨ Key Insights

### Why Incremental Deployment?
Incremental deployment only changes affected services, allowing:
- ✅ Faster deployment cycles (5-15 min vs 30-60 min)
- ✅ Minimal downtime (zero for stateless services)
- ✅ Easier rollback (revert just one service)
- ✅ Reduced blast radius (other services unaffected)

### Why 4 Separate Teams?
Independent teams enable:
- ✅ Parallel execution (4x faster)
- ✅ Specialized expertise (SDK expert ≠ Mobile expert)
- ✅ Reduced dependencies (teams don't block each other)
- ✅ Clear accountability (one team per component)

### Why ASAP Timeline?
Aggressive 4-week timeline requires:
- ✅ Clear requirements & architecture (✅ documented)
- ✅ Automated testing & CI/CD (✅ configured)
- ✅ Incremental methodology (✅ defined)
- ✅ Team coordination (✅ structured)
