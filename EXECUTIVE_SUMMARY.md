## CURRENT STATE

### ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY
- Portal rendering and accessible
- React components loading correctly
- Database operational with clean migrations
- NGINX gateway routing properly
- Build system producing production JAR
- Git repository with 23 worktrees ready
- 117 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Performance targets achieved

### ⚠️ NEEDS QUICK FIXES (9 TODOs)
- Backend port conflict (portal using 9003, need to move V11 to 9004) - 30 min
- Database schema verification - 20 min
- API endpoint connectivity testing - 15 min
- Portal-to-backend integration testing - 1-2 hours
- E2E workflow validation - 2-3 hours
- Configuration cleanup - 45 min
- Dependency conflict resolution - 1 hour
- Test coverage increase to 95%+ - 2-3 hours
- Documentation completion - 4-5 hours

**Total remaining work**: ~22 hours parallel = ~4.5 hours critical path

## SOLUTION: 3-SPRINT PARALLEL EXECUTION

### Team: 6 J4C Agents + 1 Orchestrator

**Sprint 1 (Day 1 - 6 hours)**: Backend Foundation
- Agent 1A: Fix port conflict (9003 → 9004)
- Agent 1B: Verify database schema
- Agent 1C: Test 10 API endpoints
- **Goal**: Backend operational and verified

**Sprint 2 (Day 2 - 8 hours)**: Integration & E2E
- Agent 2A: Portal-to-backend integration
- Agent 2B: E2E workflow validation
- Agent 2C: Configuration cleanup
- **Goal**: Full integration verified

**Sprint 3 (Day 3 - 8 hours)**: Quality & Documentation
- Agent 3A: Dependency conflict resolution
- Agent 3B: Test coverage 82.5% → 95%+
- Agent 3C: Complete documentation suite
- **Goal**: Production-ready quality

### Methodology
- Git worktree isolation (23 existing + 9 new)
- Daily 10:00 UTC standup (30 min)
- Parallel development (6 agents simultaneously)
- Nightly integration + testing
- Daily sprint reports

### Timeline
```
Tomorrow 10:00 UTC: Sprint 1 begins
Day 2 10:00 UTC: Sprint 2 begins
Day 3 10:00 UTC: Sprint 3 begins
December 1: All work complete, production-ready
```
