## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

- **Escalation**: Bring in additional attorney for second opinion
- **Option**: Delay publication to DAY 7 if critical issues require substantial changes

### **If Customization Takes Longer (DAY 1-2)**
- **Mitigation**: Create standard replacement list and automate with script
- **Effort**: 30 min with script vs 1-2 hours manual
- **Backup**: Template has ~20 placeholders; can manually replace in 30-45 min

### **If Attorney Turnaround Slips (DAY 3-4)**
