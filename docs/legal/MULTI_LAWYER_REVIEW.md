- Quarkus framework (Apache 2.0)
- Hibernate ORM (LGPL)
- Protocol Buffers (BSD-3-Clause)

**Current Status**: Not explicitly documented in legal documents

**Risk Level**: ⚠️ Medium (unmitigated)

**Remediation**:
1. Create SBOM.md with all dependencies
2. Add open source compliance statement to README
3. Include license attribution in EULA
4. Establish quarterly SBOM review process

### 2.4 Trade Secrets Protection

**Blockchain Algorithms** (HyperRAFT++, Quantum Crypto):
- ✅ Properly protected through confidentiality clauses in EULA
- ✅ "Proprietary Technology" language appropriate
- ✅ Reverse engineering prohibited (strong)

**Critical Issues**: 0
**High Priority Issues**: 0
**Medium Priority Issues**: 0
**Recommendations**: 5
