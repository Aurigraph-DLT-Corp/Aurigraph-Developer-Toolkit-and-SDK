**Placement:** Platform page, Developer docs
**Target:** CTOs, architects, blockchain engineers

---

## SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL: Animated blockchain network]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**
> "Consensus is the heartbeat of any blockchain. It's how nodes agree on the truth. But traditional consensus mechanisms have a problem."

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing Bitcoin (slow) vs Solana (centralized)]**

> "Bitcoin's Proof of Work? Seven transactions per second. Proof of Stake? Better, but still limited. And high-throughput chains often sacrifice decentralization."

> "Aurigraph solves this with HyperRAFT++."

---

## SCENE 2: What is HyperRAFT++? (0:30 - 1:30)

**[VISUAL: RAFT algorithm visualization]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**
> "HyperRAFT++ builds on the proven RAFT consensus algorithm, adding three revolutionary innovations."

**[VISUAL: AI neural network graphic]**

> "First: AI-driven leader election. Our neural network predicts optimal leaders, reducing convergence time to under 500 milliseconds."

**[VISUAL: Parallel shard visualization - 256 streams]**

> "Second: Parallel transaction validation. 256 independent shards process transactions simultaneously. No bottlenecks. No waiting."

**[VISUAL: Batch processing animation]**

> "Third: Adaptive batch processing. We dynamically size batches up to 100,000 transactions each, maximizing throughput while maintaining finality."

---

## SCENE 3: Byzantine Fault Tolerance (1:30 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL: 7-node validator network diagram]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**
> "But what about malicious actors? HyperRAFT++ is Byzantine fault tolerant."

**[VISUAL: 2 red nodes appear among 7]**

> "Our seven-node validator network can tolerate up to 33% malicious nodes. That's two out of seven nodes acting adversarially, and the network keeps running."

**[VISUAL: Quorum voting animation]**

> "We achieve this through a four-of-seven quorum requirement. Every block requires four honest validators to agree. Mathematically impossible to corrupt."

**[VISUAL: Validator reputation scoring]**

> "Each validator maintains a reputation score from zero to 100. Misbehave? Your score drops. Drop too low? Automatic removal from the network."

---

## SCENE 4: Performance Results (2:30 - 3:30)

**[VISUAL: Performance benchmark dashboard]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**
