Subject: URGENT - Server Connectivity Issue: dlt.aurigraph.io (Aurigraph v11.4.4 Unreachable)
Priority: HIGH
SLA: Response required within 4 hours
Escalation Contact: subbu@aurigraph.io (Subbu Jois)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

The production server hosting Aurigraph v11.4.4 blockchain platform
(dlt.aurigraph.io) has become completely unreachable as of November 10, 2025.

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- CRITICAL: Cannot verify application deployment status
- CRITICAL: Cannot access production blockchain services (776K TPS platform)
- CRITICAL: Cannot perform health checks or monitoring
- All ports unreachable: SSH (port 22), HTTP API (port 9003), gRPC (port 9004)
- 100% packet loss on ping tests (ICMP may be blocked - this is expected)

LAST KNOWN WORKING STATE:
- Date: November 9, 2025
- Application: Aurigraph v11.4.4-SNAPSHOT successfully deployed
- Health Check: Returned {"status":"UP"} at deployment time
- Process ID: 1721015 (Java application)
- JAR Transfer: Successful via SCP on port 22

CURRENT STATE:
- Server Status: Completely unreachable (all connectivity tests fail)
- SSH Access: Connection timeout (no response)
- HTTP API: Connection timeout on port 9003
- gRPC Service: Connection timeout on port 9004
- Network Tests: 100% packet loss (ping), traceroute fails

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
================================================================================

We require infrastructure diagnostics to identify root cause. Please execute
the diagnostic procedures detailed in the attached guide:
SERVER-CONNECTIVITY-DIAGNOSTIC-GUIDE.md

QUICK DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST (see attached: QUICK-DIAGNOSTIC-CHECKLIST.txt):
The checklist provides copy-paste ready commands that can be completed in
approximately 15 minutes.

================================================================================
SPECIFIC TESTS REQUESTED (In Priority Order)
================================================================================

PHASE 1: NETWORK LAYER DIAGNOSTICS (15 minutes)
-----------------------------------------------

1. DNS Resolution Tests
   - Verify domain resolves to correct IP address
   - Commands: nslookup, dig, host
   - Expected: DNS should return valid IP address
   - If fails: Check DNS provider records (may be expired/deleted)

2. Basic Network Connectivity
   - Test if server responds to ping (ICMP may be blocked for security)
   - Command: ping -c 10 dlt.aurigraph.io
   - Expected: 0% packet loss (or timeout if ICMP blocked - this is normal)
   - If fails: Continue to TCP-level tests (SSH, HTTP)

3. Network Routing Analysis
   - Identify where packets are being dropped
   - Commands: traceroute, mtr, tcptraceroute
   - Expected: Traceroute completes to destination
   - If fails: Contact hosting provider for routing investigation

PHASE 2: SSH CONNECTIVITY TESTS (10 minutes)
--------------------------------------------

4. SSH Port Connectivity
   - Verify SSH service is accessible
   - Commands: telnet dlt.aurigraph.io 22, nc -zv dlt.aurigraph.io 22
   - Also test custom SSH port if configured: port 2235
   - Expected: Port responds with SSH banner
   - If fails: Requires console/physical access to server

5. SSH Login Attempt
   - Attempt SSH login with credentials
   - Command: ssh -v subbu@dlt.aurigraph.io (or ssh -p2235 if custom port)
   - Credentials: subbu / subbuFuture@2025
   - Expected: Password prompt and successful authentication
   - If fails: See Phase 4 server-side diagnostics

PHASE 3: APPLICATION PORT TESTS (10 minutes)
--------------------------------------------

6. HTTP Port 9003 Connectivity
   - Verify application HTTP endpoint
   - Commands:
     * telnet dlt.aurigraph.io 9003
     * curl -v http://dlt.aurigraph.io:9003/actuator/health
   - Expected: Returns {"status":"UP"}
   - If fails: Application may have crashed or firewall blocking port

7. gRPC Port 9004 Connectivity
   - Verify gRPC service port
   - Commands: nc -zv dlt.aurigraph.io 9004
   - Expected: Port responds as open
   - If fails: Same as HTTP port (firewall or application issue)

PHASE 4: SERVER-SIDE DIAGNOSTICS (Requires SSH Access - 15 minutes)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Application Process Verification
   - Check if Aurigraph Java application is running
   - Commands:
     * ps aux | grep java
     * ps -p 1721015 -f  (check specific PID from deployment)
     * netstat -tulpn | grep -E "9003|9004"
   - Expected: Java process found, ports 9003/9004 in LISTEN state
   - If fails: Application crashed - check logs

9. Application Log Analysis
   - Check for startup or runtime errors
   - Commands:
     * tail -n 500 ~/aurigraph-v11.4.4.log
     * grep -i error ~/aurigraph-v11.4.4.log
   - Look for: OutOfMemoryError, BindException, ClassNotFoundException
   - Expected: "Started AurigraphApplication" message
   - If fails: Restart application or investigate error

10. System Resource Check
    - Verify adequate resources available
    - Commands: free -h, df -h, uptime
    - Expected: >1GB available memory, >10% disk space
    - If fails: Resource exhaustion - clean up or upgrade

PHASE 5: FIREWALL CHECKS (15 minutes)
-------------------------------------

11. Firewall Rules Verification
    - Check if firewall allows required ports
    - Commands:
      * sudo iptables -L -n -v
      * sudo ufw status verbose  (Ubuntu)
      * sudo firewall-cmd --list-all  (RHEL/CentOS)
    - Expected: Ports 22, 9003, 9004 allowed in INPUT chain
    - If fails: Add firewall rules (see diagnostic guide)

12. Cloud Security Groups
    - Verify cloud provider firewall (AWS/Azure/GCP console required)
    - Check: Security group attached to dlt.aurigraph.io instance
    - Expected: Inbound rules allow TCP 22, 9003, 9004
    - If fails: Update security group rules in cloud console

13. fail2ban or IP Blocking
    - Check if testing IP is banned
    - Commands:
      * sudo fail2ban-client status
      * sudo fail2ban-client get sshd banned
    - Expected: Testing IP not in ban list
    - If fails: Unban IP with fail2ban-client unban

================================================================================
TOP 5 MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSES (Prioritized)
================================================================================

1. SERVER POWERED OFF / CRASHED (Probability: 80%)
   Symptoms: 100% packet loss, all ports unreachable, cannot SSH
   Verification: Cannot access via any method
   Solution: Contact hosting provider for console access, check hardware

2. FIREWALL CONFIGURATION CHANGED (Probability: 10%)
   Symptoms: Specific ports timeout, possibly SSH works
   Verification: Can SSH but curl/telnet to 9003/9004 fails
   Solution: Check iptables/ufw/cloud security groups, restore rules

3. APPLICATION CRASHED (Probability: 5%)
   Symptoms: SSH works, but application ports not listening
   Verification: SSH successful, ps aux | grep java returns nothing
   Solution: Restart application, check logs for crash cause

4. NETWORK CONFIGURATION CHANGED (Probability: 3%)
   Symptoms: DNS fails or returns wrong IP
   Verification: nslookup fails or returns unexpected IP
   Solution: Update DNS records, wait for propagation

5. HOSTING PROVIDER OUTAGE (Probability: 2%)
   Symptoms: Everything appears correct but still unreachable
   Verification: Check hosting provider status page
   Solution: Contact hosting provider support

================================================================================
