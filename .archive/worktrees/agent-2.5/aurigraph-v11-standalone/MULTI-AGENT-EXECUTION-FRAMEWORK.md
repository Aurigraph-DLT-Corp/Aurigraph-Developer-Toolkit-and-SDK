## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This framework coordinates 4 specialized agents working in parallel across 4 concurrent workstreams to deliver Portal v4.6.0. Each agent has specific responsibilities, deliverables, and success metrics to maximize development velocity while maintaining quality.

**Agent Team**:
- **FDA (Frontend Development Agent)**: Component development lead
- **QAA (Quality Assurance Agent)**: Testing, coverage, performance
- **DDA (DevOps & Infrastructure Agent)**: Mock APIs, CI/CD, deployment
- **DOA (Documentation Agent)**: Daily tracking, release notes

**Mission**: Execute Sprints 13-15 with maximum parallelization and quality through agent coordination.

## 🚨 BLOCKER ESCALATION PROTOCOL

### Severity Levels

#### Level 1: LOW (YELLOW)
**Impact**: Single component/agent affected
**Response Time**: 24 hours
**Escalation**: Within agent team

```markdown
Examples:
- Minor API issue affecting one endpoint
- Test flakiness on single component
- Documentation clarification needed
- Code review pending > 24 hours

Action:
1. Log in daily standup
2. Agent resolves internally
3. Update in next standup
```

#### Level 2: MEDIUM (ORANGE)
**Impact**: Multiple components/agents affected
**Response Time**: 4 hours
**Escalation**: Cross-agent coordination

```markdown
Examples:
- Mock API server down
- Test framework failure
- GitHub branch issues
- Multiple component blockers

Action:
1. Immediate notification to affected agents
2. Emergency sync meeting within 2 hours
3. Resolution plan within 4 hours
4. Update all stakeholders
```

#### Level 3: CRITICAL (RED)
**Impact**: Sprint delivery at risk
**Response Time**: Immediate
**Escalation**: Project management

```markdown
Examples:
- Complete infrastructure failure
- Critical security vulnerability
- Sprint timeline at risk
- Team availability crisis

Action:
1. IMMEDIATE all-hands alert
2. Emergency response team activated
3. War room established
4. Executive escalation if needed
5. Continuous updates every 30 minutes
```

### Escalation Matrix

| Level | First Contact | Second Contact | Final Escalation | Response Time |
|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| LOW | Agent Lead | Team Lead | PM | 24 hours |
| MEDIUM | Cross-Agent Team | Technical Lead | PM | 4 hours |
| CRITICAL | PM + Tech Lead | Executive Team | CEO | Immediate |
