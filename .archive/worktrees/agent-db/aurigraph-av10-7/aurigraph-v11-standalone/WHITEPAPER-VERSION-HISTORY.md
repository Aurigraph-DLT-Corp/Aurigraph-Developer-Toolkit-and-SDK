## Upgrade Path

### V1.0 → V1.1 Migration
If you have V1.0, you can upgrade to V1.1 by:

1. **Replace the whitepaper file** with V1.1 version
2. **Update references** in any internal documentation pointing to V1.0
3. **Use V1.1 for** publication, peer review, and academic submissions
4. **Archive V1.0** for historical reference if needed

```bash
# Archive old version
mv AURIGRAPH-DLT-WHITEPAPER-V1.0.md AURIGRAPH-DLT-WHITEPAPER-V1.0-ARCHIVED.md

# Use new version as primary
cp AURIGRAPH-DLT-WHITEPAPER-V1.1.md AURIGRAPH-DLT-WHITEPAPER.md
```
