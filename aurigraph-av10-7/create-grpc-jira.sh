Implement gRPC infrastructure with Protocol Buffers for internal service communication using HTTP/2

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Protocol Buffer definitions for all services
- ✅ gRPC server implementation with HTTP/2
- ✅ Service discovery and load balancing
- ✅ TLS/mTLS authentication
- ✅ 3x performance improvement over REST

## Technical Requirements
- Use proto3 syntax
- Implement streaming for real-time updates
- Support backward compatibility
- Enable reflection for debugging

## Dependencies
- Node.js gRPC libraries
- Protocol Buffer compiler
- HTTP/2 support

## Estimated Effort
