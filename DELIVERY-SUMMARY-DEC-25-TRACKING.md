## 🔗 CRITICAL LINKS & REFERENCES

### Daily Schedule (Set Calendars)
- **8:45 AM**: Morning standup (15 mins) - Slack/Video
- **9:00 AM**: Execution starts
- **5:00 PM**: EOD status sync (10 mins) - Slack
- **5:15 PM**: Email report sent
- **5:20 PM**: Slack notification posted
- **6:00 PM**: Archive backup (automated)

### Critical Dates

- **Dec 31, 2:00 PM**: FINAL DECISION MEETING (GO/NO-GO)

### Escalation Contact Method
- **Within 5 mins**: Slack DM to on-call person
- **If no response in 5 mins**: Phone call
- **If urgent escalation**: CC Executive Sponsor

### Decision Framework
- **≥95% (35+ items)**: ✅ GO → Jan 1 start
- **85-94% (31-34 items)**: 🟡 CAUTION → Jan 1 + monitoring
- **<85% (<31 items)**: 🔴 NO-GO → Delay to Jan 2-3

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why This Framework Works

1. **Front-loaded risk**: Dec 26-27 determines 75% of success
2. **Clear triggers**: Automatic escalation prevents confusion
3. **Daily rhythm**: No surprises on final day
4. **Built-in buffer**: Deferrable items provide safety margin
5. **Real-time visibility**: Leadership always informed

### Success Factors

- **Team communicates daily** (not weekly)
- **Blockers escalated immediately** (not hoarded)
- **Metrics updated every 24 hours** (not end-of-week)
- **Stakeholders have live access** (Google Sheet)
- **Email + Slack** (redundant communication)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Waiting until Friday to report problems (Report daily!)
- ❌ Trying to fix blockers alone (Escalate fast)
- ❌ Not updating metrics on time (5:00 PM hard deadline)
- ❌ Assuming things are on track (Verify with numbers)
- ❌ Skipping team standups (15 mins saves hours)

---

## 📈 PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS

Based on completion percentage by Dec 31:

```
≥95% (35+/37): 75% success probability → GO decision likely
90-94% (33-34): 65% success probability → CAUTION acceptable
85-89% (31-32): 55% success probability → Borderline, risky
<85% (<31): <50% success probability → NO-GO likely, delay needed
```

**Key insight**: Dec 26-27 determines most of this. If Sections 1-2 hit 100%, success probability jumps significantly.

---

## ✨ FINAL NOTES

### This Framework Provides

✅ **Visibility**: Leadership knows status every day
✅ **Control**: Issues identified and escalated immediately
✅ **Accountability**: Clear ownership for each item
✅ **Flexibility**: Can defer lower-priority items if needed
✅ **Communication**: No surprises, regular updates
✅ **Documentation**: Full audit trail of execution
✅ **Learning**: Captures lessons for future sprints

### If Everything Goes Right

- Daily 5:00 PM standups run smoothly
- Blockers logged and resolved same day
- Escalations handled within SLA
- Team confidence stays 8+/10
- Metrics show steady progress
- Dec 31 GO decision confirmed
- Jan 1 launch proceeds on time
- Feb 15 production target achieved

### If Issues Arise

- Blocker discovered → Escalate per trigger matrix
- Escalation delayed → Escalate to next level
- Timeline at risk → PM + Executive decide (stretch or defer)
- Team stressed → Check morale, provide support
- Unexpected failures → Log, investigate, prevent repeat

---
